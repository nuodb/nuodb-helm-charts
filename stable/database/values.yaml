  ## Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) secrets
  # Storage passwords can be managed and stored as Kubernetes
  # secrets. TDE secrets for all databases should be created and 
  # provided before deploying NuoDB. For example:
  #   kubectl create secret generic demo-tde-secret -n nuodb \
  #     --from-literal target='topSecret'
  #
  # Note: TDE should be enabled on database layer using
  #   SQL> alter database change encryption type AES128;
  #
  # Storage password rotation is performed by updating the secret and 
  # providing the new target and historical (optional) passwords. 
  # The historical passwords are used for restoring old backup sets. 
  # For example:
  #   kubectl create secret generic demo-tde-secret -n nuodb \
  #     --from-literal target='superSecret' \
  #     --from-literal historical-20201110='topSecret' \
  #     --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
