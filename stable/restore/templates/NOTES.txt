** Please be patient while the chart is being deployed **

1) Wait for the restore job to finish:

  kubectl wait --for=condition=complete \
    --namespace "{{ .Release.Namespace }}" \
    job/{{ include "restore.fullname" . }}

2) Optionally restart NuoDB SM engines which archives are selected to be restored

To trigger database in-place restore, NuoDB database needs to be restarted. If
`restore.autoRestart` was set to `true`, then the `restore` chart will restart
the database, and the restore will proceed automatically. However, if
`restore.autoRestart` is set to `false`, then you retain control to manually
stop and restart the pods you wish. To shutdown all NuoDB processes in database
{{include "restore.target" . }}, the following command can be used:

  nuocmd shutdown database --db-name {{ include "restore.target" . }}

You could shutdown NuoDB engines in any order which will cause Kubernetes to
automatically restart all TE and SM. Alternatively, you could scale-down TE and
SM pods, and then scale up the SM pods in the order of your choosing, and then
scale-up the TE pods - again in the order of your choosing.
