# NuoDB Storage Manager (SM) Journal in Kubernetes

## Introduction

The storage manager, SM for short, is responsible for maintaining a complete copy of the database.
The atoms, database elements, are stored to either local disk, or in a separate volume.
These atoms are written by a specific module called the `archive`.
However, the archive doesnâ€™t have any special mechanisms to satisfy the durability requirements.
In addition to the archive, NuoDB storage managers also maintain a write-ahead-log called the `journal`.
The journal has the onerous task of ensuring durability in the face of an unexpected process termination.
E.g., a power loss, machine meltdown, or an unexpected cloud outage.
The journal will make sure that the archive is reconstructed in a consistent state when coming back online.

## Separating the Journal from the Archive

Since the `journal` has to write all commits durably to disk, the speed of the disk directly influences the commit latency.
To achieve the best performance, NuoDB recommends placing the `journal` on the fastest disk available.

By default, the `journal` is located in a subdirectory of the `archive`.
To achieve the best cost vs speed tradeoff, you can separate the journal from the archive.
To achieve that set the database helm template values `database.sm.noHotCopy.journalPath.enabled` and `database.sm.hotCopy.journalPath.enabled` to `true` and configure it with the desired persistence settings.

Kubernetes stateful sets volume mounts are immutable and as such, the setting can not be changed easily on an existing database.
